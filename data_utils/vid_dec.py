    Note: Setting device="cuda" outside the main process, e.g. in data loader workers, will lead to CUDA initialization errors.

    Note: Video benefits from inter-frame compression. Instead of storing every frame individually,
    the encoder stores a reference frame (or a key frame) and subsequent frames as differences relative to
    that key frame. As a consequence, to access a requested frame, we need to load the preceding key frame,
    and all subsequent frames until reaching the requested frame. The number of key frames in a video
    can be adjusted during encoding to take into account decoding time and video size in bytes.
